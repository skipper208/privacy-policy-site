## Data Collection

None of our iOS applications collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All data remains exclusively on your device. We do not have access to any information you enter or create within our apps.

## Local Storage

Our apps may store data locally on your device for functionality purposes, including:
- User preferences and app settings
- Personal tracking data (habits, moods, expenses, etc.)
- Timer presets and custom configurations
- Journal entries and personal notes
- Reminder schedules and notifications

This data never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

## Third-Party Services

Our applications do not use any third-party analytics, advertising networks, or data collection services. We do not integrate with external tracking or monitoring systems. Our apps are designed to work completely offline.

## In-App Purchases

Some of our apps offer premium features through in-app purchases. These transactions are processed through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information, which is handled securely by Apple. Premium features unlock additional functionality but do not change our data collection practices.

## Device Permissions

Our apps may request certain device permissions to provide core functionality:
- **Notifications:** For reminders, timers, and alerts
- **Local Storage:** To save your data and preferences
- **Health Data (if applicable):** For health tracking apps to read/write health data

These permissions are used only for the stated purpose and do not involve data transmission outside your device.

## Health Data (Health & Wellness Apps)

For our health and wellness applications (Period Tracker, Water Reminder, Habit Tracker, etc.), any health-related data you enter is stored locally on your device. We do not access, collect, or transmit this sensitive information.

## Children's Privacy

Our apps do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us immediately.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, your information is protected by your device's built-in security features. We recommend keeping your iOS device updated and using appropriate security measures like passcodes or biometric authentication.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
